# Flare-On 2019

This is my second time in flare-on annual challenge.
I managed to solve 11 out of 12 challenges in the given time.
These write-ups are my approach to solve these problems.
I will put challenges 1-11 write-ups here, if I managed to solve 12, I'll also upload it here.

> If you think my approach has some mistakes, or there is better/faster approach, please tell me.
