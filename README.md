# Flare-On 2019

This is my second time in flare-on annual challenge.
I managed to solve 11 out of 12 challenges in the given time.
These write-ups are my approach to solve these problems.
I will put challenges 1-11 write-ups here, if I managed to solve 12, I'll also upload it here.

> If you think my approach has some mistakes, or there is better/faster approach, please tell me.

> There are many approaches to solve each of there challenges, in my writeups I go with one approach. Sometimes my solutions takes a very long time compared to the writeups of the authors.

[this](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/09/2019-flare-on-challenge-solutions.html) link has the statistics of the CTF.
As well as write-ups by the authors of the challenges.
